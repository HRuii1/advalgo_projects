the cartographer’s silence
ashes of the sky-forged
how to train your memory to forget
the orchard at the edge of time
beneath the library of smoke
algorithms of the forgotten gods
the fourth lantern never flickers
on drowning quietly
letters to a distant mirror
the clockmaker’s dilemma
ghost census, 1893
the symmetry of broken wings
harvesting rain in the bone season
myths we buried under concrete
the infinite index of lost books
dreams licensed under patent law
of salt and stardust
exit strategy for immortals
the museum of unsaid things
when the moon forgets its name
