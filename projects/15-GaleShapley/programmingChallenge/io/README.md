# Explanation of Test Cases:

Our first four test cases consist of the following edge cases. Note that it is given in the problem that there will be at least one lab and student:

1. Single lab and single student
2. More students than labs
3. Student demand for a lab is greater than its capacity
4. One lab with no willing students

After that, we provide randomly generated cases since the output must be in a certain order whether there is a matching or not. The last testcase, testcase 26, is a one-to-one matching of labs and students with a big input.
